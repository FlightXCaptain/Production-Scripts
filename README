These Scripts are meant for beginners and beyond.
They have simply prooved useful to us as IT Administrators both locally and in the cloud.
Feel free to suggest Improvements. But i try to keep them as simple scripts for begginers in this folder.

There are 2 Types of Scripts here. Local and Azure Runbooks

Scripts can easily switched between following the below instructions and vice versa.

All Azure Automation Scripts will be using a An azure automation account to run called "Powershell" this is simply a global admin account added to the azure automate account under "Credentials" Section.
If wanting to run on your local machine simply replace this:

$AzureCredential = Get-AutomationPSCredential -Name 'Powershell'

to this:

$AzureCredentials = Get-Credentials 

And it will prompt for admin credentials instead.

Some of these Scripts can also be triggered and run from a button on your phone or a bookmark in your browser using Power Automate. Send me a message if curious about this.
